# COMP1521 Notes

COMP1521 contained work in the programming language of C and the assembly language MIPS. This repository contains simple implementations of the standard uses of these languages in a variety of contexts. It was used to prepare for my examination in the course.

## C

The C files contain a lot of bitwise operators, file operations and threads.

## MIPS

The MIPS files are simple, with basic arithemtic and functions.
